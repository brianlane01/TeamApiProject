# TeamApiProject

## Introduction

This project was created to fulfill the requirements of ElevenFifty Academy's Blue Badge Final Project.
In this project, the focus is video game creation with a focus on character creation. The user is able to create a character, adding skills, classes, weapons, and more! All group members enjoy the idea of video gaming creation and this was a fun topic for all of us. We gathered inspiration from the well-know game, Dungeons and Dragons.
